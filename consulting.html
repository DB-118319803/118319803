        <h4>What It Is</h4>

        <div>Blockchain technology provides new infrastructure to build the next innovative 
            applications beyond cryptocurrencies, driving profound, positive changes across</div>
        <div>business,communities and society.</div>
        <h4>Where It's Going</h4>

        <h3>Autonomous Things</h3>
        <div>The term “autonomous things” is being used more and more in the technology world to 
            talk about phenomena powered by the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and 
            machine learning. Autonomous things are things that work autonomously without human 
            guidance or direct intervention. </div>
        <div>Early examples include autonomous drones and 
            self-driving vehicles. Humans are used to programming things, but are not used to them 
            acting in autonomous ways. Self-driving vehicles are still making their way onto the 
            roads.</div>

        <div>Immersive virtual reality is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as 
            virtual reality art projects, for the most part.[10] It consists of immersion in an 
            artificial environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in 
            consensus reality.</div>
