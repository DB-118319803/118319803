        <div>I have been a member of Bishopstown GAA Club since the age of 5. I play both hurling and football with my club.
            GAA has helped me to develop many different skills.</div>
        <div>I have learned a great deal of discipline from playing these sports.
             I have also learned how to co-operate with others and how to work as part of a team.</div>
